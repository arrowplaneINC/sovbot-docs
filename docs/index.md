# SovBot Documentation

Welcome to the SovBot docs. This site covers workflows (like onboarding), command reference, change log, and open decisions.

- See Workflows for step-by-step flows like onboarding.
- See Commands for a strict breakdown of each command, with Current vs Expected behavior.
- Keep Outstanding Decisions up to date to avoid ambiguity.

## Notes
- These docs follow the SovBot Markdown Style Guide provided by the team.
